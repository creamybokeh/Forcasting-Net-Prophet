# Forcasting Net Prophet

This program helps predict if search traffic correlates to stock price movement. It was written for MercadoLibre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. The program visually depicts seasonal Google search traffic and evaluates how the search traffic compares to closing stock price. Additionally, the program uses Facebook Prophet to predict and visually display hourly serach traffic. The ultimate goal of the program is to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate to making successful stock trades.

This application is compatible with Python 3.9.
It is a Juypter Notebook file that has been created and run inside of Google Colab.

Find out about and sign up for Google Colab [here.](https://colab.research.google.com)

The pystan, fbprophet, hvplot and holoviews libraries must be installed prior to using. The first cell in the program contains installation prompts for these libraries. Simply run it and they will install automatically.

The Pandas and pathlib libraries were used along with matplotlib and datetime and must be installed externally in order to run the program correctly.

Pandas is used for data science and analysis and machine learning.

Pathlib is used point Python to file paths.

HvPlot allows for the creation of interactive graphs and plots of data.

matploblib is a library used for creating visualizations in Python.

This program will work on Windows, MacOS and Linux with Python 3.9 installed. The user will need to run the program in a code editor such as Juypter Lab or Visual Studio Code.

Documentation for the Pandas library can be found [here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Documentation for the pathlib library can be found[here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

Documentation for hvplot can be found [here.](https://hvplot.holoviz.org)

Documentaiton for matplotlib can be found [here.](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
